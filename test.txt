There is a girl whom I talk to for a while.
We haven't meet ever, not even in IEM.
I told her about that too, but it doesn't seem to be a big deal to her, for her long distance is same as f2f.

1.She claims she is single(ie apart from me).
2.She didn't tell any of her family members about me inspite of me telling mine.
3.She only proactively kept bugging me to get my attention, I didn't, infact I didn't pay much heed initially.
4.

Q.
1.Is she treating me as timepass or does she have intensions of serious relationship ?
2.
